    <h1>Summary</h1>

    <h2>Educational Background and Early Achievements</h2>
    <p>At Cheldoktran High School, which served over 4,000 students, I thrived due to the competitive environment. I achieved my seventh year as Student of the Year and served as a representative on the Student Committee.</p>
    <p>Alongside my school studies, I pursued additional English and mathematics education. I hold English diplomas from the Muslim English Language Institute and Kateb University, and I scored 83 on the trial TOEFL test. I was also awarded for my excellence in mathematics by the Kawsar-e-Danish Educational Center.</p>
    <p>During the Kawsar-e-Danish Educational Center explosion, I employed first aid skills and took immediate action to save the lives of three students, earning a letter of appreciation from Dr. Shizaman Hussaini Bakhtiyari for my bravery.</p>

    <h2>International Experience and Personal Development</h2>
    <p>Following the Taliban's invasion and school closures, I embarked on a study trip to Pakistan on August 15, 2022 to study at International Grammar School and Colledge (IGSC). During less than a year of study, I earned many honors and expanded my global network with friends from countries including the USA, Canada, Australia, Italy, England, Norway, Switzerland, Pakistan, Iran, and Nigeria.</p>
    <p>This international experience enhanced my cultural understanding and personal growth. I developed leadership skills in basketball, achieved recognition as the best female goalkeeper in football, excelled in badminton, and was a top competitor in races.</p>
    <p>Living abroad independently allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses, fostering significant personal development.</p>

    <h2>Return to Afghanistan and Entrepreneurial Ventures</h2>
    <p>In May 2023, I returned to Afghanistan due to a visa issue. With my background in Business and Economics from IGSC, I initiated a business focused on property rental, but it was unfortunately shut down by the Taliban.</p>
    <p>I am currently working with Ms. Khadija Nazari, a Brown University student, on a project that manufactures traditional Afghan goods. This venture aims to provide employment for women and introduce Afghan culture globally.</p>
    <p>We plan to manufacture thousands of goods crafted by Afghan women, amplifying their voices and providing hope amid the current challenges in Afghanistan.</p>

    <h2>Community Involvement and Leadership Roles</h2>
    <p>For over six months, I have been a member of the Kakrak Council, focusing on aiding disadvantaged people, particularly women and children. Simultaneously, I have participated in the Calaster program, where I became a student representative, group leader, and assistant director.</p>
    <p>In the Calaster program, I engaged in mathematics, chemistry, and physics studies, and participated in empowerment classes led by Aziz Royesh. This experience has bolstered my mental resilience and crisis management skills, allowing me to assist girls in overcoming personal challenges in Afghanistan.</p>

    <h2>Global Peace Initiatives and Certifications</h2>
    <p>I am an active member and leader in the Peace on Earth by 2030 initiative, which works towards global peace. As the leader of the Dream Group, I oversee educational programs for over 4,000 Afghan girls in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
    <p>I secured first place in a debate on sustainable peace organized by the Sustainable Peace Developers group and completed the Life Skills Program at the Rebuild Institute, focusing on communication and emotional management.</p>
    <p>Recently, I completed the Transition to Success Program at the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) and am preparing for the TOEFL test, having scored 105 on the unofficial Duolingo test.</p>

    <h2>Ongoing Education and Professional Development</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled at High Bluff Academy (HBA), studying a diverse curriculum that includes science (chemistry, biology, and physics), math, American history, business, and economics, all in English. I am also participating in the FemTech program from the University of Luxembourg, focusing on business management and womenâ€™s leadership.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I teach English voluntarily at Nokhbagan Bamika High School and have completed web development and accounting courses at the American University of Central Asia. I also participated in the Phone Distance School program, which emphasized personal growth and English proficiency.</p>
